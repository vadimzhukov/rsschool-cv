### Code sample

Here is the sample of code of my game pet-project:
```
fetch('https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=9&difficulty=easy&type=multiple')
    .then(res => {
        return res.json();
    })
    .then(loadedData => {

        questions = loadedData.results.map(loadedQuestion => {
            
            //Start formatting the required structure of question+choices objects
            
            let adoptedQuestion = {
                question: htmlDecode(loadedQuestion.question)
            }

            const answerNumber = (Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1);

            adoptedQuestion.answer = answerNumber;
            //temp array to save answers for current question
            const answers = [...loadedQuestion.incorrect_answers.map(answer => htmlDecode(answer))];
            answers.splice((answerNumber - 1), 0, htmlDecode(loadedQuestion.correct_answer));

            answers.forEach((item, index) => {
                adoptedQuestion['choice' + (index + 1)] = item;
            });
            return adoptedQuestion;
        });
        startGame();
